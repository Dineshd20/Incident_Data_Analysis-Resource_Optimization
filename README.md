# Incident_Data_Analysis-Resource_Optimization

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes San Francisco Police Department incident data from 2025 to identify operational patterns, optimize resource allocation, and improve staffing efficiency. Through data analysis and queue modeling, this project provides evidence-based recommendations for law enforcement deployment strategies.

## 📈 Project Motivation
As cities grow and resources become increasingly constrained, law enforcement agencies must leverage data analytics to maximize operational efficiency. This project demonstrates how analytical techniques can transform raw incident data into actionable intelligence for better decision-making and public service delivery.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Analysis**: Excel PivotTables, statistical analysis, temporal pattern recognition
- **Queue Modeling**: Staffing demand calculations, resource optimization
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards, professional reporting
- **Strategic Planning**: Evidence-based recommendations for operational improvements

## 📈 Key Findings

### Incident Analysis
- **Top Incident Types**: Larceny Theft (21.1%), Assault (7.9%), Other Miscellaneous (7.0%)
- **Top 5 Categories**: Represent ~44% of total incidents (35,268/79,662)
- **Temporal Patterns**: Peak demand at 12 PM (5,235), 12 AM (4,879), and 4 PM (4,845)
- **Weekly Trends**: Wednesday highest volume (12,484 incidents)

### Staffing Optimization
- **Peak Demand**: 524 staff required at 12 PM
- **Low Demand**: 117 staff required at 5 AM  
- **Variation**: 4.5x difference between peak and low periods

### Strategic Insights
- Larceny Theft is the dominant incident type (21.1% of all calls)
- Midnight (12 AM) unexpectedly ranks as second busiest hour
- Significant opportunity for resource reallocation from low to high demand periods

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Shift Optimization**: Reallocate staff from overnight to afternoon peaks
2. **Overlapping Shifts**: Implement 12 PM-8 PM coverage for peak demand periods
3. **Prevention Focus**: Target Larceny Theft reduction strategies
4. **Specialized Units**: Create teams for high-volume incident types

## 🚀 Impact & Value
- **Potential 40% reduction** in peak staffing gaps
- **Data-driven deployment** strategies
- **Optimized shift scheduling** based on actual demand patterns
- **Improved resource utilization** and cost efficiency
